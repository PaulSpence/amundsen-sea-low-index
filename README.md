# Amundsen Sea Low Index (v3)

Amundsen Seas Low (ASL): a highly dynamic and mobile climatological low pressure system located in the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean. In this sector, variability in sea-level pressure is greater than anywhere in the Southern Hemisphere, making it challenging to isolate local fluctuations in the ASL from larger-scale shifts in atmospheric pressure. In Hosking et al., 2013* we demonstrated that the position and strength of the ASL are crucial for understanding regional change over West Antarctica.

The ASL indices are defined using an ASL detection methodology very similar to that described in Hosking et al. (2016) although (rather than IDL) it is now written in Python (i.e, this repo). Therefore, this methodology and any associcated indices/derived data will be henceforth referred to as 'version 3' (or 'v3') as the method is non-identical to the previous one (version 2). Versions 1 and 2 of the ASL indices (which were in any case derived on ERA-Interim reanalysis data, and not ERA5) can be found on our [legacy webpage](https://legacy.bas.ac.uk/data/absl/index2.html).
