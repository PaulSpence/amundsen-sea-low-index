# Amundsen Sea Low Index (v3)

![ASL image](asl.jpg) 

The Amundsen Seas Low (ASL) is a highly dynamic and mobile climatological low pressure system located in the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean. In this sector, variability in sea-level pressure is greater than anywhere in the Southern Hemisphere, making it challenging to isolate local fluctuations in the ASL from larger-scale shifts in atmospheric pressure. The position and strength of the ASL are crucial for understanding regional change over West Antarctica. 

The ASL indices are defined using an ASL (low pressure system) detection methodology written in Python (i.e, this repo).
